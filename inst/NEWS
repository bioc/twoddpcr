  classification methods.

Bug fixes:
* Minor fix removing conflicts in the dropletPlot documentation.

twoddpcr v1.0.0 (Release date: 2017-04-25)
============

First full release incorporating all of the devel updates.

============

Updates as suggested by anonymous reviewers.

Shiny app:
* Simple dynamic HTML report generation.
* Re-use the user-specified labels in plots and tables (where possible). NN, 
  NP, PN and PP are still used internally and for file input/output.
* Add captions to pages, improve the help sidebars and page.

Vignette:
* Describe the KRASdata dataset.
* Compare the classification methods with discussion.

Bug fixes:
* k-means failed when only one class was present.

twoddpcr v0.99.1 (Release date: 2017-02-16)
============

More R-like changes as suggested by Martin Morgan at Bioconductor.

Main changes:

* ddpcrPlate objects can be subsetted like a list
* The amplitudes() function replaces getDroplets() and getAllDroplets()
* wellClassification() and plateClassification() replace the old get/set
  methods and can be set using <-
* Changes to improve the robustness and clarity of the code


twoddpcr v0.99.0 (Release date: 2017-01-24)
============

First devel release.

twoddpcr is an R package for Droplet Digitial PCR (ddPCR) analysis. The name of 
the package reflects the package's support for analysing two channel ddPCR 
data.

Key functionality:

* Create ddpcrPlate objects
* kmeansClassify() classifies droplets using k-means clustering
* mahalanobisRain() refines the classification, removing ambiguous droplets
